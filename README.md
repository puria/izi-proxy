## How to Install

```bash

```

## Example

import IziProxy from 'izi-proxy'

// Configure Let's Encrypt settings to get SSL certificate
var proxy = new IziProxy({
    maintainerEmail: "example@email.com", // your email
    staging: true // true for testing, false for production (only after testing!)
});

// Just bind your domain to internal address - common example
// with parameter boolean activeGreenLock for greenlock activation
proxy.register(["exxxample.com", "uptime.exxxample.com"], ["http://localhost:3001"], true);

proxy.start();
```
